## v1.5.0 — 2026-05-18

Mirrors `PROJECT_STARTER.md` template v1.5.0.

### Codex review automation

- Add `templates/.claude/skills/request-codex-review/SKILL.md` — one-command path to trigger Codex review of the current branch's PR. Detects PR number via `gh pr view`, composes a canonical invocation comment that names `docs/pr_review_instructions.md` explicitly (so Codex reads the rubric), posts via `gh pr comment`, confirms, stops. Does NOT poll for results — Codex posts back to the PR async.
- Add `make request-codex-review` Makefile target — wraps the same canonical comment for one-shot terminal invocation outside Claude sessions.
- Documents the re-review pattern (post a second comment naming "addressed prior findings, N new commits") and the no-mid-branch / no-state-mutation-beyond-comment guardrails.

Implements D-006. Adds B-008.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-05-18

Mirrors `PROJECT_STARTER.md` template v1.4.0.

### PR review (reviewer-agnostic + Codex default)

- Reframe `templates/docs/pr_review_instructions.md` with a reviewer-agnostic preamble: rubric + output contract apply to any reviewer (Codex, `/ultrareview`, other LLMs, manual). Independence beats deepening — a different model with fresh context catches what the original missed.
- Rewrite `PROJECT_STARTER.md` §2.7 and `templates/CONTRIBUTING.md` §4: introduce a reviewer matrix (Codex / `/ultrareview` / other LLM / manual) with cost/independence trade-offs. **Default: Codex** via its GitHub App.
- Codex invocation subsection: install GitHub App (one-time); PR comment names the rubric explicitly (`@codex review — follow docs/pr_review_instructions.md ...`); reviewers run serially, not in parallel.
- Output contract preserved verbatim and made universal: per-commit comments via `gh api` (or reviewer's native PR-comment integration), explicit "no findings on `<sha>`" on clean commits, severity-grouped summary at end.
- The `review gogogo!` verb mapping intentionally unchanged — user does PR review separately when the branch is finished; no in-session reviewer dispatch needed.

Implements D-005. Adds B-007.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-05-17

Mirrors `PROJECT_STARTER.md` template v1.3.0.

### Gate convention

- `gogogo!` is now the **execute trigger**; it must be preceded by an **action verb** in the same message specifying *what* to execute. Bare `gogogo!` (no verb) is ambiguous — Claude asks "Which action?" and stops. (`PROJECT_STARTER.md` §2.1, `templates/CLAUDE.md`, `templates/CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- New verb → workflow table covers: `code/feat/fix/... gogogo!` (full 5-step), `commit gogogo!`, `PR gogogo!`, `review gogogo!`, `merge gogogo!`, `deploy gogogo!`, `revert gogogo!`.
- §2.6 (PR) and §2.9 (merge) updated to reference the new explicit phrases (`PR gogogo!`, `merge gogogo!`) instead of bare imperatives.
- Cheat-sheet and TL;DR in `templates/CONTRIBUTING.md` updated to match.
- Two new rationalizations added to the refuse-list: "bare `gogogo!` → default to 5-step" and "verb-A `gogogo!` is close enough to authorize action B".

Implements D-004 (`docs/spec.md`). Adds B-006.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-05-17

Mirrors `PROJECT_STARTER.md` template v1.2.0. First release of this repo as a standalone template kit; previously imported as `project-starter-v1.1.8-2026-05-07.tar.gz`.

### Gate

- Rename the work-authorization passphrase `code!` → `gogogo!` across all template files. Universal across stacks and action types, not just code edits. (PROJECT_STARTER.md §2.1, templates/CLAUDE.md, templates/CONTRIBUTING.md, templates/docs/spec.md, templates/CHANGELOG.md, templates/README.md, ~50 sites)
- Memory-seed file rename: `code_gate_workflow.md` → `gogogo_gate_workflow.md` (PROJECT_STARTER.md §10)

### Karpathy's four pitfalls

- Add `templates/docs/karpathy-claude-rules.md` — full write-up of the four LLM-coding failure modes (unexamined assumptions, overengineering, collateral changes, no verification) with counter-rules, attribution, and how they fit the 5-step workflow.
- Add a condensed `## Coding pitfalls to avoid (Karpathy's four)` section in `templates/CLAUDE.md` so the rules load every session, not just when someone reads `docs/`.
- Link the new doc from `templates/README.md`'s doc table.

### Spec-blocks

- Add `templates/.claude/skills/spec-block/SKILL.md` — interactive skill that walks through writing one Block at a time (Title / Rule / Rationale / Test / Status / Decision), finds the next free `B-NNN`, and inserts in `docs/spec.md` without committing.
- Replace the placeholder bullet-list `## Frozen behavior` in `templates/docs/spec.md` with the fixed Block format + editing rules + a seed `B-001` placeholder.

### This repo

- Adopt the workflow on this repo: add `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/spec.md` (written in the new Block format — eating our own dog food).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-17 (implicit)

Initial import of `project-starter-v1.1.8-2026-05-07.tar.gz` to `main` as a single commit (no VERSION file at the time). v1.2.0 is the first release with the workflow fully applied to this repo.
